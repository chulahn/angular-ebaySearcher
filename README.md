an app that gauges price for items on eBay

<h3>About</h3>
This is a webapp that searches eBay based on a query and gives statistics(min, max, avg, etc.) about price.  It shows that data over time on a graph.  The user can filter items from the results based on date, price restraints, and title.  The user can select the auctions he wants and see the statistics for that on the right hand side.

<h3>Why?</h3>
After working on the Diablo 3 project for so long, I got tired of it and wanted to do something new.  At the time, I was an avid sneaker collector, and I wanted to buy shoes for under market price.  In order to gauge the price I would browse eBay and see completed auctions of shoes.  I wanted to somehow automize this process and I had heard about AngularJS and wanted to somehow incorporate that into this project.
